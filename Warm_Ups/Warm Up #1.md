## Warm Up #1

#### Set up:  

Create a folder on your computer where you will create your coding warm ups using the terminal window.

Open a new jupyter notebook in that folder.  

Complete this assignment in that jupyter notebook and save to your computer.

1. Create a dictionary where each object contains a list of one float (Age) and one string (Family name) (at least 5 objects) 
<br>Example: {Charles: [23.4, "Darwin"], Alan: [42.5, "Turing"]}



2. Delete one object from the dictionary

3. Replace the float number of one of your objects - we are changing a list entry inside a dictionary record! look at Darwin's new age
<br>Example: {Charles: [99.73, "Darwin"], Alan: [42.5, "Turing"]}

4. Write a for loop that goes through all records in the dictionary, and assigns the float numbers into one merged list (see ages)
<br>ages = [23.4, 22.9, 552.9]

#### BONUS

Calculate with a for loop the median and mean of the ages list


```python

```
